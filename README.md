# PILP-Solver
Implementation of an algorithm to computes the breakpoints (and facets) of a parametric ILP.


The implementation is based on the paper:

BÃ¶kler, Fritz and Mutzel, Petra: Output-Sensitive Algorithms for Enumerating the Extreme Nondominated Points of Multiobjective Combinatorial Optimization Problems, Algorithms-ESA, DOI 10.1007/978-3-662-48350-3_25, 2015.
